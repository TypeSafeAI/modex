# Design tokens: where the numbers come from

`src/renderer/tokens.css` holds the current Modex tokens. This file records the original Codex
desktop measurements behind the shell geometry and type scale. The 2026-10-03 visual refinement
keeps those dimensions while giving Modex a cooler graphite palette. `e2e/layout.spec.ts` asserts
the current values, so future changes remain deliberate and reviewable.

## Current visual direction

The main canvas stays near-black (`#0e1218`). A slightly lighter graphite sidebar and a softer
composer separate navigation, work, and input without heavy outlines. Cool blue appears at focus
and active states. Text values have more contrast than the original samples, especially for labels,
placeholders, and tool metadata. Very low-opacity light on the titlebar, upper canvas, and composer
adds depth; the layout keeps its measured 42 px titlebar, 48 px rail, 240 px sidebar, and 736 px
composer. Motion remains short and follows the existing reduced-motion setting.

## Reference

Codex desktop screenshots at **1786×1049, 1× scale**. The red traffic light measures 12 px, which is
macOS's native size, so screenshot pixels map 1:1 to CSS px. The images show private project names and
stay out of the repo. Coordinates below are for screenshot #1: the empty "What should we build in
coven-threads?" screen, with the sidebar expanded and the composer at the bottom.

## Original colour samples

Surfaces are single flat pixels. Text is the **brightest glyph-core pixel** in the text's box, because
anti-aliased edges are darker than the real colour.

| Token | Value | Sampled at (x,y) or box |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg-window` | `#1b1b1c` | (600,20) titlebar, (23,400) rail |
| `--bg-sidebar` | `#131315` | (170,120) |
| `--bg-main` | `#0f0f11` | (1000,300) |
| `--bg-row-selected` | `#222224` | (160,181), the selected project row |
| `--bg-composer` | `#262729` | (1000,975) |
| `--bg-composer-context` | `#151517` | (1000,912), the project · Local · branch strip |
| `--bg-user-bubble` | `#1a1a1c` | user message, screenshot #8 |
| `--border-pane` | `#2a2a2b` | x=289, the sidebar/main divider |
| `--border-rail` | `#1f1f21` | x=48 |
| `--border-composer` | `#2b2c2e` | (668,975) left edge, (1000,931) top edge |
| `--rule` | `#1f1f21` | rule under "Working for 7s", screenshot #8 |
| `--text-1` | `#e3e4e6` | heading box 795–1276 × 476–506. Also the context strip and model label |
| `--text-2` | `#c4c5c6` | thread row "Review incomplete tasks" 89–250 × 235–252. Project row reads `#c7c7c9` |
| `--text-3` | `#757577` | "Show more" 89–162 × 523–539. Model effort "High" reads `#7f8082` |
| `--text-4` | `#5c5c5f` | "Projects" 65–120 × 142–158 |
| `--text-placeholder` | `#535455` | "Do anything" 680–760 × 947–963 |
| `--accent-warn` | `#dc9258` | "Full access", most saturated pixel in 735–802 × 999–1015 |

**Derived** (no reference pixel): `--bg-row-hover`, `--bg-elevated`, `--bg-sunken` and
`--border-strong`, each chosen between measured neighbours. `--accent` stays Modex's blue. Codex is
monochrome apart from "Full access".

## Type sizes

Cap heights can't tell 13 px from 14 px apart: both render a 10 px cap. So sizes are fitted by
**ink width**. The same string is measured in Electron's own font stack (`-apple-system`, canvas
`measureText` actual bounding box) and compared with the reference ink width. PIL's SF Pro render
isn't a substitute: it lacks the small-size optical tracking and reads 1–2 px narrow.

| String (where) | Reference ink px | Best fit | Token |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Full access" (composer bar) | 65 | 13/400 = 65 | `--text-sm` |
| "coven-threads" (context strip) | 87 | 13/400 = 87 | `--text-sm` |
| "GPT-6 Astra" (model label) | 74 | 13/400 = 73 | `--text-sm` |
| "Do anything" (placeholder) | 76 | 14/400 = 75 | `--text-md` |
| "New chat" (sidebar) | 60 | 14/400 = 59, 14/500 = 60 | `--text-md` |
| "Review incomplete tasks" (row) | 159 | 14/400 = 157, 14/500 = 161 | `--text-md` |
| "Show more" (sidebar) | 71 | 14/400 = 71 | `--text-md` |
| "Projects" (section label) | 53 | 14/500 = 52 | `--text-md`, medium |
| "Codex" (sidebar title, cap 13 px) | ≈52 | 18/600 | `--text-lg` |
| "What should we build in coven-threads?" | 481 | 28/400 = 480 | `--text-xl` |

## Radii

Measured along the top edge of a filled box: the number of pixels, row by row, before the fill starts.
The inset profile is then compared with a circle.

| Token | Value | Profile (inset px, rows from the top edge) |
|---|---|---|
| `--radius-row` | 10 px | selected row at (57,166): 9 5 4 3 2 1 1 1 1 0 |
| `--radius-composer` | 20 px ±2 | composer at (668,931): 18 15 12 11 7 6 5 6 5 5 4 3 3 3 2 2 0. The 1 px border's anti-aliasing adds noise; Phase 4 re-checks it against the rendered box |

## Geometry

Consumed by later phases, asserted in `layout.spec.ts` as each phase ships: rail 48 px, sidebar
240 px (x 49–288), 1 px dividers, titlebar ≈42 px, composer ≈736×98 at x 668–1403 / y 931–1028,
context strip 38 px tall (y 893–931) starting at x 681.

## Capture size in CI

GitHub's macOS runner has a small display, and macOS clamps a window to the screen, so captures came out
at 1024×677. The e2e window now opens with `enableLargerThanScreen` when `MODEX_E2E` is set, and the capture
test **fails** if the viewport isn't 1786×1049. A local check asked for 4400×2600, larger than any
attached display: with the flag the window got 4400×2600, and without it the height was clamped to 1050.
