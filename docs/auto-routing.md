# Auto routing with Jev

Auto is the ⚡ toggle in the composer. When it is on, Modex asks a small, fast judge a few
typed questions about each request *before* the turn runs, then picks the backend, model,
reasoning effort, and fast mode for that turn — within limits you set — and shows a
one-line receipt in the transcript explaining why. The coding turn itself still runs only
through the `claude` and `codex` CLIs; nothing about Auto changes that.

## What the judge is

The judge is **Jev**, TypeSafe's System One model. It does not generate text and never sees
your files; it answers typed questions about a compact digest of the request and returns
calibrated probabilities. Modex asks six questions in one request
(`apps/desktop/src/main/engine/routing/judge.ts`, question set v1):

| id | type | what it decides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task` | choice | quick answer · small edit · bug fix · feature · refactor · investigation · review · ops · unclear |
| `complexity` | score 0–3 | one-step … cross-cutting, each level a concrete situation |
| `blast_radius` | score 0–2 | one file … could delete data / rewrite history / touch other systems |
| `wants_speed` | noul | the user signalled a quick turnaround matters more than thoroughness |
| `needs_deep_reasoning` | noul | doing it well needs multi-step reasoning about interactions |
| `depends_on_prior_turns` | noul | only when the thread has history: the request leans on it |

The state sent is the request (clipped to 4k chars), the last six turns as short digests
(user/assistant text clipped, tool titles), and thread/project facts (backend, mode, plan,
turn count, project name, branch). No file contents, diffs, or tool output are sent.

## Key and transport

The key can live in any of these places; Modex checks them in this order and tells you
which one won in Settings → Auto routing:

1. **Modex itself** — paste it into Settings. It is encrypted with the OS keychain
   (Electron `safeStorage`: macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI, or the Linux keyring) and written
   to `~/.modex/app/secrets.json` with mode 0600. It is never in `state.json`, never in a
   build, and the renderer only ever sees the last four characters.
2. `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` or `JEV_API_KEY` in Modex's environment.
3. **The `jev` CLI's config**, `~/.config/jev/config.json` (`JEV_CONFIG` overrides), written
   by `jev config set apiKey …` — one configuration for every tool on the machine.
4. `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` from your login shell, because a Finder-launched app inherits no
   profile.

Any of those may hold a **1Password reference** (`op://Vault/Item/field`) instead of a
literal key; Modex expands it in memory through `op read` at use time and reports a
locked vault as the problem rather than silently judging with the heuristic.

The judge itself is reached one of two ways (Settings → Judge transport):

- **`jev` CLI** (default when installed): Modex runs `jev run - --raw` with the payload on
  stdin and the resolved key in the child's environment only. That gives Modex the CLI's
  config, its retries, its error messages, and `jev doctor`, and keeps one code path for
  people, scripts, and agents. Install with `npm link` in `TypeSafeAI/cli`.
- **Built-in HTTPS** (`POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone`): the same request from
  Modex's own process, used when the CLI is absent or the policy says so.

Transport selection is explicit: **Auto** prefers the CLI and may fall back to HTTPS;
**Always the jev CLI** never uses HTTPS if its executable is unavailable; **Always HTTPS**
does not inspect the CLI. Saving changed judge transport, executable, or model settings
invalidates resolved setup without clearing learned preferences or disrupting an
already-running turn. General, posture-only, and no-op saves retain connection-test health.

"Test judge" sends one tiny question through whichever is active and shows the answer or
the API's own error sentence (a `402` with no credits, a `401` for a rejected key). A
rejection disables Jev for the session — no per-turn retry latency — until the key changes
or a test succeeds. With no key and no CLI, Auto still works on the built-in heuristic and
every receipt says so.

Pricing and limits, from the TypeSafe model page at the time of writing: `jev-latest` →
`jev-1.13.0`, charged per input token at $0.042 per million (output free), 32k tokens of
state per request. A routing call sends a few hundred tokens, so Auto costs well under a
hundredth of a cent per turn and typically answers in well under a second; a turn waits at
most 8 s for the judge before falling back to the heuristic.

## What code decides

Jev's answers are raw judgments. The policy (`routing/policy.ts`) turns them into a route,
deterministically, and every step that changes the outcome adds a reason to the receipt:

1. **Confidence gate.** If Jev's confidence in the task kind is below `min_confidence`
   (default 0.6), Auto keeps whatever the thread was already using and says so. A blank
   model means the CLI's advertised default. When no effort was requested, it uses that
   model's default effort or medium, matched to supported levels under the active ceiling.
2. **Target tier.** Starts at the complexity score; +1 for deep reasoning; +1 for a wide or
   hard-to-reverse blast radius; a quick answer with low complexity pins tier 0; posture
   shifts one tier down (economy) or up (quality); the learned per-task offset is added;
   clamped to 0–3; capped at 2 once the daily premium budget is spent.
3. **Backend.** Stays put unless `allow_backend_switch` is on **and** the thread has no
   existing CLI session. Even then it only moves to an allowed backend when the current CLI cannot reach the target tier or is
   unavailable. Mid-thread switches lose the CLI's context, so this is off by default.
4. **Model.** The highest rung at or below the target tier on that backend
   (`routing/catalog.ts`). The ladder is rebuilt from the CLI's live model list: Claude's
   aliases (haiku 0 · sonnet 1 · opus 2 · fable 3) and Codex's catalogue (gpt-5.5 0 ·
   gpt-5.6-* 1 · gpt-6-luna/sol 2 · gpt-6-astra 3), with description hints for anything new
   and the middle tier for unknowns.
   Successful non-empty lists are cached for a minute. A failed or empty list retries on
   the next turn; discovery errors appear in receipts and any resulting stop message.
5. **Effort.** Tier sets the base (low/medium/high/xhigh); deep reasoning bumps one; an
   explicit speed signal drops one; `max_effort` caps it; the budget caps it at high. The
   result snaps to an effort the model actually lists. Claude gets `--effort`, Codex gets
   the per-turn `effort` field.
   Supported-effort matching and low-confidence routes also obey the ceiling. If an Auto
   turn cannot establish a supported effort within the limit, it stops before coding
   execution with an explanation instead of silently using an unknown provider default.
   Once the daily premium budget is spent, Auto also stops if the only usable model is top
   tier or a low-confidence judgment pins a top-tier model. Pinned premium Auto routes count
   toward the same daily limit.
   The offline mock backend has no reasoning-effort dimension. Blocked turns do not consume
   the routing budget or teach learned preferences.
   Blocked receipts read "Auto blocked". A manual model repair after a block does not
   teach a tier preference from an older successful route.
6. **Fast mode.** Only when the user signalled speed, the task is not reasoning-heavy, the
   pick is tier ≤ 1, and the model offers it. Codex: the `fast` service tier for this turn
   only (`serviceTierForTurn`). Claude: `--settings '{"fastMode":true}'` for the session.

Changing the policy never requires re-asking Jev; the raw judgments are reusable.

Learning-file writes are best-effort after a safe decision: a write failure appears in
the receipt without blocking the coding turn or changing its outcome. Premium counts and
learning stay in memory for the session and are included in the next successful write.
They cannot survive an app restart until persistence succeeds.

## The follow-up question

After a turn completes, the composer offers one next message. The candidates are fixed
strings in `routing/followup.ts` (verify, review, investigate, plan, explain, continue), so
nothing the judge says can become prompt text: it only picks a key, or `none`.

What leaves the process is `followUpState`: the request, the task kind from the heuristic,
plan and mode, and four booleans about the completed turn — whether tools edited files, ran
checks, whether any tool failed, and whether the answer mentions remaining work. Assistant
text, tool arguments and tool output stay local; the unit test asserts the request never
carries them. Jev is asked only on Auto threads, with the same confidence floor as routing;
a non-Auto thread, an offline judge, a low-confidence or unknown choice, and every error fall
back to `fallbackFollowUp`, which prefers a failed tool → investigate, plan mode → plan,
"next steps" → continue, edits → review (checks ran) or verify (they did not), quick answer
→ explain, else continue.

The runner caches one answer per transcript state, so the renderer can ask on every render
without asking Jev twice for the same turn. A new send or Stop cancels and clears it, and a
turn that ended in an error or a Stop offers nothing.

## How it learns you

`~/.modex/app/routing-fit.json` (`routing/fit.ts`) keeps a per-task-kind tier offset:

- You pick a different model by hand on an Auto thread → strongest signal. Choosing a higher
  tier than Auto did nudges that task kind up by 0.34 tiers (three consistent overrides move
  it a full tier); a lower one nudges down. Modex confirms what it learned in a notice.
- An Auto turn fails → a small nudge up (0.1).
- Offsets are clamped to ±1.5 and rounded to the nearest half tier when applied, so one
  override never flips a decision on its own.

The file also counts premium turns per day (`premium_turns_per_day` bound) and keeps the
last 200 routing records with outcomes, which is the dataset a future calibrated fit model
(or a threshold sweep in `.probes/`) would train on. Settings → "Reset learning" clears it.

## Bounds you control

Settings has separate General, Coding CLIs, Auto routing, and Advanced sections, with Save
and Cancel kept visible while the content scrolls. Auto routing exposes posture, effort
ceiling, minimum judge confidence, premium turns per day, fast-mode allowance, backend
switching, and whether new threads start on Auto, plus the judge model and allowed coding
backends. All of these are `settings.routing` in `~/.modex/app/state.json`.

Ordinary settings are drafts until Save. Saving waits for persistence before publishing
new in-memory settings; a failed save keeps both the active configuration and the draft
available for retry. A view-refresh failure after persistence is reported as a
refresh failure rather than claiming that the save failed. Cancel, Escape, and backdrop
dismissal discard drafts and are blocked while an asynchronous settings action is pending.
Draft edits and other actions are disabled until the current operation settles.

Credential Save/Clear and Reset learning are separate immediate actions: Cancel does not
undo them. Learning reset requires confirmation. Keys remain encrypted outside state.json;
the UI receives only masked key metadata.

The allowed coding-backend list governs switching destinations; it does not move an
existing session or enable switching by itself. An empty list keeps the current backend.
Legacy Mock entries remain available for offline routing until explicitly disabled in
Advanced / demo; the menu identifies them separately from coding CLIs.

Test judge uses the saved judge configuration. If transport, executable, or judge model
has an unsaved change, apply it before testing. Configured/untested, explicitly verified,
and failed tests are distinct; results identify their configuration and are invalidated
when that configuration changes. Opening Settings never performs a paid provider ping.

## Which CLIs, and local models

Modex drives coding agents only through their CLIs, so a routing target is any CLI that
Modex has a backend for. Surveyed on 2026-09-25:

| CLI | headless protocol | approvals | model / effort control | verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Codex** (`codex app-server`) | JSON-RPC over stdio, streaming items | server→client requests | `model`, `effort`, `serviceTierForTurn` per turn; live `model/list` with efforts and service tiers | shipped; the richest surface |
| **Claude Code** (`claude -p`) | stream-json in/out | `control_request` on stdio | `--model`, `--effort low…max`, fast mode via settings | shipped |
| Gemini CLI | `-p --output-format stream-json` | `--approval-mode default/auto_edit/yolo/plan` (no per-call prompt channel found) | `-m` | good next candidate once its permission prompts can be answered from a host |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `-p` | `--allow-all-tools` only | `--model` (incl. `auto`) | possible for chat/plan modes; no interactive approval path yet |
| opencode (installed build) | `-p -f json` | none | none in headless | not a fit for agent mode |
| **Local models** | via **Codex** `--oss --local-provider lmstudio|ollama` (LM Studio has `qwen/qwen3.5-9b` on this machine) | Codex's | Codex's | the right way in: a tier-0 rung on the Codex ladder, no API mode in Modex |

Recommendation: keep Claude and Codex as the routing targets now; add local models as a
Codex profile (`codex --oss`) rather than a new backend, so `AGENTS.md`'s CLI-only rule
holds; evaluate Gemini CLI as the third backend when its headless approvals can be driven.

## Verifying

- Unit: `npm test -w @modex/desktop` covers the heuristic judge, the policy table, the fit
  arithmetic, the router with a fake Jev transport and with Jev failing, and the runner
  applying a route before a turn.
- End to end: `npm run test:e2e` toggles Auto on the mock backend and checks the receipt.
- Live: export `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, start Modex, turn on Auto, send a request; the receipt
  reads "Jev 0.xx". Settings distinguishes configured transport from a successful explicit
  Test judge result; a routing receipt alone is not a claim that all provider capabilities
  or future availability have been verified.
