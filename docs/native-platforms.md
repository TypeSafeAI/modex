# Native Windows and Linux candidates

Development commands: `npm run dist:windows -w @modex/desktop` and
`npm run dist:linux -w @modex/desktop`. Each requires its native x64 host. Windows
also needs an MSVC x64 tools environment. The commands build core and desktop,
write candidates under `apps/desktop/release/native-{win32,linux}`, and never publish.

Windows NSIS installers are unsigned, per-user, do not launch automatically after
installation, and retain application data on uninstall. Linux targets are AppImage
and Debian (`modex`). macOS release-signing rules remain unchanged.

The Native platform builds workflow tests CLI arguments and Windows process ownership,
then builds candidate installers. Artifacts expire after three days. A manifest records
SHA-256 hashes, sizes, source commit/run identity, and installer acceptance as pending.
The first hosted run compiled the Windows helper with MSVC and passed twelve CLI and
process-ownership checks. Its interactive PTY case failed while observing resize, then
left the test runner alive. The fixture now writes to the console so Node can observe
Windows resize events, and teardown closes the PTY even after an assertion failure.
Native re-verification is pending. Linux GCC rejected unchecked terminal receipt writes;
the helper now handles partial writes, interruption and errors. No installers were built
in that run. See [the initial native run](https://github.com/TypeSafeAI/modex/actions/runs/38134189896).

Before release, collect native evidence for installed startup, packaged Electron addon
and helper loading, CLI arguments and account/login launches, PTY input/resize/Ctrl-C,
natural exit/close/disposal/owner-death cleanup of detached descendants, DPAPI and
libsecret/KWallet behavior (including unavailable-backend refusal), manual upgrade with
preserved data, and uninstall without unrelated data loss. Windows/Linux updates remain
manual. Candidate artifacts and cross-compilation do not satisfy these gates.

Windows job ownership covers ordinarily created descendants, not service/WMI execution.
Custom batch launchers are refused; recognized plain npm Node wrappers launch the real
Node entrypoint with unchanged arguments. Linux credentials require an encrypted storage
backend and preserve existing files when storage is unavailable.

Local verification for the isolated platform change: full monorepo build, 480 passing
tests, desktop typecheck, configuration validation and workflow lint. Eleven tests are
skipped: ten require Windows and one is the existing opt-in live Knowledge test. Strict
Windows cross-compilation passes; the hosted results above provide the limited native
evidence gathered so far.
The Codex process-cleanup fixture also now waits for a valid PID; a deliberately delayed
PID write reproduces the earlier false process-survival assertion before the fix.

The packaged-demo test now uses the test process PATH instead of reading the user's
login profile. A controlled nine-second login shell reproduced its eight-second
approval timeout; the same test passes with profile lookup disabled through the existing
test seam. Production demo deadlines are unchanged.
