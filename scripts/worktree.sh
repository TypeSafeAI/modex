# and is never edited directly. main is protected (signed commits + green CI), so work lands
# through a PR.

#   scripts/worktree.sh remove <name>   remove the worktree (refuses if it has uncommitted changes) and its local branch if merged
#   scripts/worktree.sh check           exit 1 with a hint when run from the primary checkout (agents call this first)
