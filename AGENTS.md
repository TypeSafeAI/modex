# Working in this repository

These rules apply to every session — a person in a terminal, Claude Code, Codex, or Modex
itself driving one of them.

## One worktree per session

- **Never edit in the primary checkout.** It stays on `main` and only ever receives
  `git pull`. Each session gets its own worktree under `.worktrees/<name>` on a branch of
  the same name, cut from `origin/main`:

  ```sh
  scripts/worktree.sh new <name>      # prints the worktree path; cd into it
  scripts/worktree.sh check           # exits 1 if you are still in the primary checkout
  scripts/worktree.sh remove <name>   # after the PR merged
  ```

  Pick a short slug for `<name>` that says what the session is doing (`thinking-item`,
  `fix-scroll`, `ci-macos`). `.worktrees/` is git-ignored.
- Two sessions must not share a worktree or a branch. If you find commits you did not make
  on your branch, stop and reconcile before pushing.
- Modex's own worktree threads (`⑂`) honour this convention: when a project ships
  `scripts/worktree.sh`, Modex calls `new modex-<thread id>` / `remove …` on it, so threads on
  this repo land in `.worktrees/` like any other session. Projects without the script get a
  plain `git worktree` under `~/.modex/worktrees/`.

## Landing changes

- `main` is protected by a ruleset (`.github/rulesets/main.json`): **signed commits** and
  the **`unit + e2e (macOS)`** check are required; direct pushes are rejected.
- Flow: worktree → signed commits (`git commit -S`) → push the branch → PR → CI green → merge
  (squash). Then `scripts/worktree.sh remove <name>`.
- Before pushing, run what CI runs: `npm run build && npm test` and, for UI changes,
  `npm run test:e2e`.

## Where things are

- `apps/desktop` — the Electron app (`src/main` process + backends, `src/renderer` React UI,
  `e2e/` Playwright). `packages/core` — the offline scripted engine used by demos and tests.
- `docs/release-signing.md` — how release builds are signed and notarized, and where the
  credentials live (never in the tree). `npm run dist` stays ad-hoc for everyday builds.
- `docs/status.md` — what has shipped, what is on `main` but unreleased, what is in flight, what is
  next. Update it in the PR that changes any of those. `docs/reviews/` holds release evidence.
- Real models run only through the `claude` and `codex` CLIs. There is no API mode for
  coding turns; do not add one. App-owned Sign in with ChatGPT may make authentication-only
  requests to OpenAI's authorization, OpenID metadata/JWKS, token and revocation endpoints;
  tokens stay in main-process OS-encrypted storage and the account's Codex child environment.
  These calls never carry prompts or files or execute inference. The other network call outside the CLIs is the optional Auto
  routing judge (Jev, `apps/desktop/src/main/engine/routing/`), which answers typed questions
  about a request and never runs a turn or sees file contents; without `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`
  it is replaced by a built-in heuristic. See `docs/auto-routing.md`.
- Scratch scripts go in `apps/desktop/.probes/` (git-ignored). Playwright wipes
  `apps/desktop/test-results/` on every run.
